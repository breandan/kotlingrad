    abstract = {Predicting protein structure from sequence is a central challenge of biochemistry. Co-evolution methods show promise, but an explicit sequence-to-structure map remains elusive. Advances in deep learning that replace complex, human-designed pipelines with differentiable models optimized end-to-end suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating structure prediction. Here we report the first end-to-end differentiable model of protein structure. The model couples local and global protein structure via geometric units that optimize global geometry without violating local covalent chemistry. We test our model using two challenging tasks: predicting novel folds without co-evolutionary data and predicting known folds without structural templates. In the first task the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and in the second it comes within 1-2{\r A}; competing methods using co-evolution and experimental templates have been refined over many years and it is likely that the differentiable approach has substantial room for further improvement, with applications ranging from drug discovery to protein design.},

    abstract="In this paper we analyze several new methods for solving optimization problems with the objective function formed as a sum of two terms: one is smooth and given by a black-box oracle, and another is a simple general convex function with known structure. Despite the absence of good properties of the sum, such problems, both in convex and nonconvex cases, can be solved with efficiency typical for the first part of the objective. For convex problems of the above structure, we consider primal and dual variants of the gradient method (with convergence rate {\$}{\$}O{\backslash}left({\{}1 {\backslash}over k{\}}{\backslash}right){\$}{\$}), and an accelerated multistep version with convergence rate {\$}{\$}O{\backslash}left({\{}1 {\backslash}over k^2{\}}{\backslash}right){\$}{\$}, where {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}is the iteration counter. For nonconvex problems with this structure, we prove convergence to a point from which there is no descent direction. In contrast, we show that for general nonsmooth, nonconvex problems, even resolving the question of whether a descent direction exists from a point is NP-hard. For all methods, we suggest some efficient ``line search'' procedures and show that the additional computational work necessary for estimating the unknown problem class parameters can only multiply the complexity of each iteration by a small constant factor. We present also the results of preliminary computational experiments, which confirm the superiority of the accelerated scheme.",
