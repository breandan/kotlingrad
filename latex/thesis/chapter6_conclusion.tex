In this thesis, we explored four different programming tools from software engineering for the development of intelligent systems, broadly addressing cognitive complexity arising in four phases of Royce's Waterfall method~\autoref{fig:waterfall_model}. These tools have varying degrees of practicality, from highly theoretical (e.g. adversarial testing of differentiable programs ~\autoref{ch:difftest}) to more pragmatic (e.g. containerization ~\autoref{ch:ducker}). In each chapter, we provide some motivating examples which demonstrate key deficiencies in state-of-the-art programming tools for intelligent systems and propose viable solutions which address a few of those shortcomings. While we hope that intelligent system programmers (e.g. roboticists and machine learning practitioners) may derive some value from the tools themselves, our intention is to be \textit{illustrative} rather than \textit{prescriptive}.

In building tools and validating their effectiveness on toy applications, it is our hope that tool developers will carefully consider how software tools can reduce cognitive complexity. Tools can augment the cognitive capacity of humans to reason about facts in the presence of uncertainty~\citep{famelis2012partial}, and provide ergonomic debugging and visualization assistance (e.g. \autoref{ch:hatchery}). We also hope to convey the importance of notation. Good notation forces authors to think carefully about their abstractions, makes logical errors conspicuous, and helps them to understand the implications of early design choices. We hope that the programming tools presented in this thesis will inspire developers to re-imagine the potential for computer-aided programming in designing software for intelligent systems.

By complementing the cognitive abilities of human programmers -- who excel at creative problem solving and high-level abstract reasoning -- with the raw symbolic processing abilities of programming tools, we can accelerate the design~\autoref{ch:hatchery}, development~\autoref{ch:kotlingrad}, validation~\autoref{ch:difftest} and deployment~\autoref{ch:ducker} of intelligent systems in real-world applications. This process is a virtuous cycle which deserves domain-specific tools and practices due to the opportunities which intelligent systems afford and the unique interplay between human and machine intelligence. As we begin to develop autonomous systems which play increasingly active roles in society, both software engineers and machine learning practitioners must play an active role in shaping the behavior of those systems.

Software engineers have a number of lessons to learn from intelligent systems. Language designers would do well to consider the value of smart developer tools (\autoref{ch:hatchery}) in facilitating the dialogue between human and computer interaction. Languages should strive to incorporate human knowledge via differentiable programming and expert [type] systems to reason about compositionality over those programs (\autoref{ch:kotlingrad}). Automated testing via simulators and property testing frameworks are needed to reason about correctness without exhaustive user specification (\autoref{ch:difftest}). Finally, continuous integration, automated testing and best practices in developer operations (\autoref{ch:ducker}) are needed to ensure reproducible artifacts in the presence of software and hardware variability.

Machine learning practitioners also have a number of lessons to learn from software engineering. Traditional software engineering prescribes a rigorous process model and testing methodology (\autoref{fig:waterfall_model}) which has guided many generations of software projects. To become a true engineering discipline, machine learning will need a more disciplined approach to building autonomous systems. Machine learning models are trained on \textit{objective functions}, which are typically low-dimensional functions measuring the performance of a system, returning a scalar value known as an \textit{error} or \textit{loss}. In practice, intelligent systems must satisfy a multiobjective set of criteria~\citep{censi2015mathematical}, including energy efficiency~\citep{paull2010novel}, memory~\citep{memory2013mitliagkas}, re/usability~\citep{breuleux2017automatic,deleu2019torchmeta}, predictability~\citep{turner2017well}, latency~\citep{ravanelli2018twin}, robustness~\citep{pineau2003policy}, explainability~\citep{turner2016model}, traceability~\citep{guo2017semantically, tsirigotis2018orion}, un/certainty~\citep{diaz2018interactive}, simplicity~\citep{kastner2019representation}, trustworthiness~\citep{xu2017efficient}, transferability~\citep{mehta2019active}, scalability~\citep{luan2019break} and many other factors.

In traditional software engineering, it is reasonable to assume those who are implementing a new system have some implicit domain knowledge and are well-intentioned human beings working towards a common goal -- given a coarse description, they can fill in the blanks. When building an intelligent system, we would be safer to assume the requirements are implemented by a devious genie. Given some data and an optimization metric, it will take every available shortcut to grant our wishes. If we are not careful about correctly stating our requirements, this entity will produce a solution that simply does not work (in the best case), or appears to work but is truly cursed~\citep{bellman1957dynamic}.

When building an intelligent system, developers must carefully ask, ``What is the expected behavior of the system we are designing?'' This question is often very troublesome, for the requirements cannot be loosely specification, but precise constraints on the solution space. For example, when designing a self-driving vehicle, we must clearly optimize for passenger safety, however doing so na\"ively will train a vehicle that never moves, or always yields to passing vehicles. Short of exhaustively specifying the requirements, how can we be assured the resulting system satisfies our requirements? Most humans are capable of safely driving a vehicle, but even the best engineers struggle to write a driving algorithm. Labeling the data by hand is too expensive. Formal verification is right out the window.

    \label{fig:verification_complexity}
\end{figure}

Type systems, compilers and fuzzers are all part of a broader class of validation and verification tools. The goal of these tools is to trade cognitive complexity for computational complexity. Some errors (e.g. syntactical errors), are minor nuisances and can be detected with a good incremental parser (\autoref{subsec:the-parser}). Others, as shown in~\autoref{fig:verification_complexity}, have higher cognitive complexity but can be detected by spending computation. We argue this computational cost is often justified as computation is cheap and undetected bugs can have catastrophic consequences. Studies show the earlier bugs are detected, the more likely they are to be fixed~\citep{distefano2019scaling} -- saving minutes in development could save lives during operation. Spending computation frees up valuable cognitive resources for other tasks.

Fuzz testing remains an economically and computationally efficient alternative to formal verification. As we show in \autoref{sec:prob_ad_test}, by making practical assumptions about the model and oracle, we can spend a fixed computational budget to detect more severe errors with lower fiscal and computational overhead. As today's engineers begin to incorporate learning in tomorrow's safety-critical robotic systems, we believe the increased assurance provided by intelligent validation and verification tools will be indispensable for the widespread deployment of these complex adaptive cyberphysical systems.

Much work remains for the interested reader. A great deal of work in machine learning is designing representations which are suitable for downstream tasks and loss functions which accurately measure performance on those tasks. Building representations and loss functions which capture the full range of objectives can be a painstaking process to debug. We encourage engineers to think carefully the process of debugging machine learning models and how it can be accelerated.

Machine learning researchers would do well to consider the value of denotational semantics for grounding specifications. Their abstractions are very powerful. Computer aided reasoning tools will both play an important role in the development of intelligent systems. We encourage the reader to look carefully at value type systems provide, and when they fall short, consider using property checking techniques and continuous integration methods for ensuring correctness.

\section{Contributions}

There are many interesting codesign problems at the intersection of tools, languages and systems~\autoref{fig:venn_triagram}. In this work, we consider the theory and implementation of programming tools for intelligent systems. The opposite direction is also an intriguing subject, but remains outside the scope of this thesis. PL designers have recently begun to explore the meaning of ``toolable'' languages and tooling-enhanced languages~\citep{chatley2019next}. Other tools for intelligent systems include notebooks~\citep{chattopadhyays2020notebooks}, REPLs and interactive programming environments. Each of these would be an interesting thesis in its own right.

Our contributions in this particular thesis are fourfold. In \autoref{ch:hatchery}, we introduce a new plugin for the IntelliJ Platform, an integrated development environment with support for the Robot Operating System. Several domain specific languages for intelligent systems have recently emerged~\autoref{sec:differentiable-programming} for differentiable and probabilistic programming. In \autoref{ch:kotlingrad} we introduce one more, an embedded DSL in the Kotlin language allowing users to write shape-safe differentiable programs in a mathematically idiomatic notation.

Reproducibility is a broad challenge in intelligent systems design, requiring a multi-pronged solution. We believe testing and validation of intelligent systems will play an important role in safety-critical applications. Automated testing and simulation, as well reproducible build and deployment tools will be essential for robustness. In \autoref{ch:difftest}, we introduce a general purpose property-based testing algorithm and empirically show an improvement in data efficiency by detecting a greater fraction of errors in a fixed computational budget. Finally, in \autoref{ch:ducker}, we present a fully-containerized build environment and continuous integration workflow, improving the re/usability and re/producibility of software deployment for the Duckietown platform. Together, these contributions help to alleviate cognitive complexity when designing, developing, testing and deploying autonomous systems.
